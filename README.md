# Learn MQTT Protocol using Go

## Overview

This application allows you to learn and experiment with the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol using the Go programming language. MQTT is a lightweight and efficient messaging protocol commonly used in IoT (Internet of Things) and other applications for efficient data exchange.

## Building and Running

To use this application, follow these steps:

### Build the Application

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the following command to build the application:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
### Running the Application

After successfully building the application, you can run it using the following command:

```
    ./main
```
The program will start, and you can begin your MQTT learning journey.

## Exiting the Application
To exit the application, follow these steps:

1. When prompted by the program to finish the app, you can type "n" and press Enter.
2. The program will gracefully disconnect from the MQTT server and exit.

# Usage

This application provides a hands-on learning experience for MQTT. You can explore and experiment with various MQTT features and scenarios, such as publishing and subscribing to messages.

Please refer to the source code (main.go) for specific MQTT actions and interactions that you can experiment with.
# MQTT Broker Configuration

Before running this application, ensure that you have access to an MQTT broker. You need to configure the MQTT broker's connection details in the source code (main.go) to connect to the broker of your choice.

# Additional Resources

If you want to learn more about MQTT and its applications, consider referring to the official MQTT documentation and resources available online.

Happy learning with MQTT and Go!
